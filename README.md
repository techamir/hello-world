# hello-world
I am going to be a great programmer 
I am so lucky to get an opptortunity to learn programming language and distribute my time to build what i will call my future aplication that i will help people with.  I am goal minded, ambitious, hungry, humble, and business mined also to build one day a very good business for my family to continue and run as a empire. I will build with hard work and patience.
